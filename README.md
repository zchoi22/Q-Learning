# Q-Learning

What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q Learning, or Quality Learning, as a form of learning that optimizes the total reward to find the most efficient solution. It's a model-free reinforcement algorithm, meaning Q Learning can adapt to different environments without changes in the algorithm.

What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
RL is sort of the "brute force attack" of learning, becoming better by running through an environment many times. Compared to ML, which uses data to predict based on datasets, RL resembles artifical intelligence less-so. However, ML and RL can be used together, often with ML used to optimize predictions within RL. Interestingly, RL ties to the law of effect (operant conditioning including reinforcement) in psychology, where rewards incentive better behavior.

What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
Model-free means that Q Learning doesn't rely on prior knowledge of an environment to work. The algorithm should function regardless of the environment.

What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
Q Learning has been used in self-driving cars, natural language processing, learning applications in many different fields, and more. https://neptune.ai/blog/reinforcement-learning-applications
